# BG-IW stands for Bellum Galaxy Interplanetary Weapon

Looks like a bad thing, isn't it? Come with me and take a look closely.

## What it is?
The Bellum Galaxy Interplanetary Weapon is the ULTIMATE EDUCATIONAL AND INCLUSIVE TOOL!
I, Barba, have been in web3 for about six months(01/2024), and until today, I have found courses that teach how to build a protocol or YouTube classes that teach how to interact with protocol A or protocol B on mainnet. But, until today, I've never seen an initiative that teaches What it is, How it Works, and How to build in practice.

So BG-IW will be built to do this. To bring together development and interaction to onboard everyone who wants to learn about the ecosystem without costing any money to those who want to learn.

### *<drama.moment>* With all my A HUNDRED EIGHT THREE days of experience, I reached the following opinion...*</drama.moment>*
- For those who want to be developers, would be nice if they build something that is used daily on the web3 ecosystem, and not just build, but learn how it works and what is the purpose of that.
- For those who just want to interact and invest, would be nice if they knew how protocol A or B works and what they should expect. This way, we can prevent hacks in general.

And now? What is your opinion about our interplanetary weapon? Looks like a bad thing yet?

Oh, you are tough, aren't you? Let's keep going.

## How it works?
**Under development.**

## Who is the target audience?
This weapon will be build to be utilized by anyone. The goal is that after you take the "milk way" you never get lost again.

*I hope that you get the reference*

That being said, after finishing this journey, you will be a ruthless traveler who will fear no more. That will not depend on other people's opinions because you will know how to **DO YOUR RESEARCH**.
