# BG-IW stands for Bellum Galaxy Interplanetary Weapon

Looks like a bad thing, isn't it? Come with me and take a look closely.

## What it is?
The Bellum Galaxy Interplanetary Weapon is the ULTIMATE EDUCATIONAL AND INCLUSIVE TOOL!
A different way to learn. I, Barba, have been in web3 for about 6 months(01/2024) and until today I've always found courses that teach how to build a protocol or YouTube classes that teach how to interact with protocol A or protocol B on mainnet. But, until today, I've never seen an initiative that teaches What Is, How it Works, and How it's built in practice.

So BG-IW will be built to do this. To integrate building, interacting, and onboarding everyone who wants to learn about the ecosystem without costing any money to those who want to learn.

### *<drama.moment>* With all my A HUNDRED EIGHT THREE days of experience, I reached the following opinion...*</drama.moment>*
- For those who want to be developers, would be nice if they build something that is used daily on the web3 ecosystem, and not just build, but first learn how it works and what the purpose of that is.
- For those who just want to interact and invest, would be nice if they knew how protocol A or B works and what they should expect. This way, we can prevent hacks in general.

And now? What is your opinion about our interplanetary weapon? Looks like a bad thing yet?
Oh, you are tuff. Let's keep going.

## How it will work?
