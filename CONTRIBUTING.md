## Coding Style

- Please follow the instructions on [Coding Style](./code-style/code-style.md) to contribute to this project. If you are not used to any pattern used in there, think of this as an opportunity to practice. Those patterns will help you in the future.
- Always include in-line comments in the contract. Remember that this project is educational and non technical people will read them.

## External Tools

- **DO NOT** modify the layout of external contract tools like Chainlink's. Only modify what is really needed. This way other contributors can follow the tool's doc.

## New Features

We are open to aggregating new features that can contribute to the project's purpose. Please read [New Features](https://github.com/BellumGalaxy/BG-IW/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BIMPROVEMENTS%5D) and follow the New-Feature template.

## Pull Requests

- **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
- **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs. A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.
- **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. "Improve code coverage for System.Console by 10%", not "Fix #1234")
- **DO** refer to any relevant issues, and include [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
- **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
- **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds. The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it'll be merged.
- **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary. This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.
- **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.

## Bug triage
This sections explains how bug triaging is done.

You can help report bugs by filing them [here](https://github.com/BellumGalaxy/BG-IW/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG+REPORT%5D).

You can look through the existing bugs [here](https://github.com/BellumGalaxy/BG-IW/issues).

You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:

* Is the bug reproducible as explained?
* Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?
* Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?
* What tags should the bug have?
* Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?

You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are still happening.

## Community
